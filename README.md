# From Nand to Tetris
As a Computer Science Student in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I was required to take the From Nand to Tetris course.
This is a course that teaches you about logic gates, hardware, compilers and operating systems, using Python as the main language.
It lasted 13 weeks, in which, we've submitted a total of 12 exercises in various fields and topics.
